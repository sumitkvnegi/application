# how to work with me in this project 

- clone this repo in your local systems

```
git clone <repository-url>
```

- I encourage you to maintain a separate branch 

```
git checkout -b feature-branch-name
```

- You can make changes to the codebase in your respective branches. you can add, modify, and delete files as needed.

- After making changes, you should commit those changes to your local branches.

```
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
```

-  you can create pull requests to propose changes to the main branch. 

- I will review the changes and, if everything is fine, I will merge them into the main branch.

```
git pull origin main
```

- I suggest you to have a clear communication with me and feel free to ask anything regarding the project.
